# BattleshipDemo
This will be a demonstration for my final project for my course CSCI 1112. The project will be a game based on the classic battleship game. Only this time it is single-player only. The game will feature a 10 x 10 grid as the "sea". The game will also have randomly generated battleships as the targets. The targers of course will not be visible to the player.
## Target Population:
This is meant as a simple game to pass time. Anyone over the age of 7 will be able to turn it on and have fun. This can be played while on the train or on the toilet. Key appeals for this game include the simplicity and speed of the game. This should be appealing to parents especially since there won't be pesky ads to lure their children.
## Purpose to the consumer:
This software will be unique in that it will have no ads or fillers. Lots of ads these days for kids games are obvious click baits to get the child to press a button and take them out of the game. This game will not do that. It will be safe for all. In fact this game will not connect to the internet so there are virtually no risks whatsoever.

Just a quick simple open the software and play. This should be helpful for those that are impatient or in a hurry. This game will also be good for kids traveling that need some extra distraction sometimes. This game will also help teach deductive reasoning. It will also be great practice for learning letters and numbers and how to type them on a keyboard.
## Constraints:
It is possible that a player will give a wrong coordinate. They might also use the same coordinate twice. This is not acceptable. To avoid this, there will be a try and catch field to make sure only acceptable coordinates will go through. Another constraint is to make sure that the battleships get generated correctly and do not have parts that are out of bounds.
## Conclusion:
I hope this project will increase my skills in programming. This project will also increase my understanding of video game development. If this project is accepted it will allow me to advance in my courses. This project includes a GUI and the battleship objects.  It should take me about 15 hours to complete.
