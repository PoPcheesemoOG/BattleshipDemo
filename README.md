# BattleshipDemo
A demontration of a battleship type game on JavaFX. The player will be presented with a 10 x 10 grid that has 5 battleships hidden in the water. The player then must enter the coordinates into a textfield and hope they land a hit.
## Target Population:
This is meant as a simple game to pass time for anyone interested. This can be played while on the train or on the toilet. The simplicity and speed of this game should make it appealing as a quick little time killer.
## Purpose to the consumer:
This software will be unique in that it will have no ads or fillers. Just a quick simple open the software and play. This should be helpful for those that are impatient or in a hurry.
## Constraints:
It is possible that a player will give a wrong coordinate or use the same coordinate twice. To avoid this, there will a try and catch field to make sure only acceptable coordinates will go through.
## Conclusion:
I hope this project will increase my skills and understanding of video game development.
